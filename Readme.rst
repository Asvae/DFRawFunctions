Introduction
============

DFRawFunctions is a MediaWiki extension designed for parsing Dwarf
Fortress raws.

.. contents::

df_type
----
usage: {{#df_type:DATA|OBJECT|REQUIREMENT|TYPE|NUMBER|DESCRIPTION}}

Finds any object with filled requirement. Returns type.
Number could be:
*		returns whole list of Types, numbered and comma separated
* -1		Ðºeturns the very last input with fulfilled requirements and Type	
* N		returns reaction number N, no formatting
* N:FORMAT"	returns reaction number N, wiki table formatting and Description
* N:CHECK	checks if Nth Type is the last one, returns error if it's not.

	
Input:  {{#df_type:Masterwork:reaction_kobold.txt|REACTION|BUILDING:BONEYARD_KOBOLD|NAME|1:FORMAT|[[Vermin]] in not useless.}}
Output: 

df_keybind
----
Parses a raw keybinding string into a readable result.

Usage: {{#df_keybind:string|display_text|separator}}
Parameters:
* string
- The raw keybinding string
* display_text (Optional, default: $1)
- The text to be displayed for each key. $1 or \1 will be replaced by the key's
value.
* seperator (Optional, default: -)
- The text displayed between each key

Example::

{{#df_keybind:SHIFT_ALT_E|[$1]|+}}

gives::

[ALT]+[E]

df_building
----
Provides information about workshops and furnaces. 

**Syntax:** ``{{#df_building:DATA|BUILDING|OPTIONS}}``

* BUILDING - should be either workshop or furnace with syntax as follows:  ``BUILDING_FURNACE:MAGMA_GENERATOR`` or ``NAME:Magma Generator (Dwarf)``.
* OPTIONS - you have to put ":" between parameters, their position won't matter.
 * LOCATION - returnts tiled image, depicting passability and work location (not implemented)
 * TILE - returns tiled image of workshop
 * COLOR - returns tiled and coloured image of workshop
 * N - where N is 0, 1, 2 specifies building stage (3 by default)
 * BUILD_ITEM - returns build items (not implemented)

 :**Input**:``{{#df_building:Masterwork:building_kobold.txt|BUILDING_WORKSHOP:GONG|COLOR:3}}``
 :**Output**: Colurful image

df_tile
----
Makes HTML and wiki supported tiles from ones used in raws. Only TILE is mandatory. Three other values can be omitted.

**Syntax:** ``{{#df_tile:TILE|COLOR|IMAGE|STEP}}``

* TILE is tiles from raws, &lt;br/> should be placed between lines
* COLOR is same as TILES, but color
* IMAGE is a wiki styled image link
* STEP is size of tile in pixels

**Input:**  ``{{#df_tile:43:222:219<br/>33:214:184|3:5:1:3:5:1:3:5:1<br/>3:5:1:3:5:1:3:5:1|[[File:Phoebus 16x16.png|link=]]|16}}``

**Output:** Coloruful image

df_raw
------
Searches through a raw file and returns raws for a specific object. If
only "data" is specified, the entire contents of the raw file are
returned.

Usage: {{#df_raw:data|object|id|notfound}}
Parameters:
* data
- Either a filename (of the format "namespace:raw_file.txt") or its
  contents.
* object
- The object type to search for.
* id
- The ID of the object you are searching for. Objects begin with
  "[object:id]" (e.g. [INORGANIC:SANDSTONE] or [CREATURE:DWARF])
* notfound
- The string to be returned if the specified entity could not be located.

Example: {{#df_raw:DF2012:creature_standard.txt|CREATURE|DWARF|Not found!}}

df_tag
------
Checks if a particular tag exists, optionally with a specific token at
a specific offset. Returns 1 if found, otherwise returns nothing.

Usage: {{#df_tag:data|type|offset|entry}}
Parameters:
* data
- The raws for a single object.
* type
- The tag type you are searching for.
* offset
- Optional, specifies an offset to check for a specific value.
* entry
- Optional, specifies the actual value to look for at the above offset.

Example: {{#df_tag:[dwarf raws]|PERSONALITY|1|IMMODERATION}}


df_tagentry
-----------
Finds the Nth tag of the specified type, with any number of specific
tokens at specific offsets, and returns the token at the specified
offset.

Usage: {{#df_tagentry:data|type|num|offset|notfound|matches...}}
Parameters:
* data
- The raws for a single object.
* type
- The tag type you are searching for.
* num
- The instance of the tag you want to fetch. Specify a negative number
  to count from the end.
* offset
- The offset of the token to be returned. Specify a pair of numbers
  separated by colons in order to return a range of tokens (also
  separated by colons).
* notfound
- The string to be returned if the specified entity could not be
  located.
* matches
- Zero or more match conditions. Match conditions are of the format
  "offset:value". Only the Nth tag which satisfies all match conditions
  will be returned.

Example: {{#df_tagentry:[dwarf raws]|PERSONALITY|0|2:4|Unknown!|1:IMMODERATION}}


df_tagvalue
-----------
Finds the Nth tag of the specified type and returns all of its values,
separated by colons.

Usage: {{#df_tagvalue:data|type|num|notfound}}
Parameters:
* data
- The raws for a single object.
* type
- The tag type you are searching for.
* num
- The instance of the tag you want to fetch. Specify a negative number
  to count from the end.
* notfound
- The string to be returned if the specified entity could not be
  located.

Example: {{#df_tagentry:[dwarf raws]|BODY_SIZE|0|Unknown!}}


df_foreachtag
-------------
Iterates across all tags of the specified type and outputs a formatted
string for each one.

Usage: {{#df_foreachtag:data|type|string}}
Parameters:
* data
- The raws for a single object.
* type
- The tag type you are searching for.
* string
- A format string into which token values can be substituted using \1,
  \2, ..., \9. The first parameter is the tag name itself. Currently
  does not support more than 9 parameters.

Example: {{#df_foreachtag:[stone raws]|ENVIRONMENT_SPEC|"\2"}}


df_foreachtoken
---------------
Iterates across a set of tokens in specific groups and outputs a
formatted string for each one.

Usage: {{#df_foreachtoken:data|offset|group|string}}
Parameters:
* data
- A colon-separated list of values, usually the output from
  df_tagvalue.
* offset
- How many tokens to ignore from the beginning of the list.
* group
- How many tokens should be parsed at once.
* string
- A format string into which token values can be substituted using \1,
  \2, ..., \9. Currently does not support more than 9 parameters.

Example: {{#df_foreachtoken:
           {{#df_tagvalue:[dwarf raws]|TL_COLOR_MODIFIER|0}}
         |0|2|"\1"}}


df_makelist
-----------
Iterates across all objects in a single raw file and outputs a string
for each one.

Usage: {{#df_makelist:data|object|string|extracts...}}
Parameters:
* data
- Either a filename (of the format "namespace:raw_file.txt") or its
  contents.
* object
- The object type to iterate across.
* string
- A format string into which values can be substituted using \1, \2,
  ..., \9. Currently does not support more than 9 parameters.
* extracts
- Zero or more token extraction parameters. Extraction parameters are
  of the format "type:offset:checkoffset:checkvalue", where the first
  matching tag of "type" will return the token at "offset" if the token
  at "checkoffset" has the value "checkvalue". If "checkoffset" is set
  to -1, the checkvalue is ignored.
- For material definitions, the format "STATE:type:state" can also be
  used, where "type" and "state" are fed into df_statedesc below.
- The order in which the extraction parameters are defined will
  determine the substitution values used - the first will use \1, the
  second will use \2, etc.

Example: {{#df_makelist:[all stone raws]|INORGANIC|"\2 \1"|
           ENVIRONMENT_SPEC:2:1:MAGNETITE|STATE:NAME:SOLID}}


df_statedesc

state.

Usage: {{#df_statedesc:data|type|state}}
Parameters:
* data
- The raws for a single material.
* type
- Either NAME or ADJ, to specify whether the noun or adjective form
  should be returned.
* state
- The state type whose name should be returned. Valid values are SOLID,
  POWDER, PASTE, PRESSED, LIQUID, and GAS.

Example: {{#df_statedesc:[stone raw]|NAME|SPOLID}}


df_cvariation
-------------
Parses a creature entry and decodes variation information.

Usage: {{#df_cvariation:data|base|variation...}}
